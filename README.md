HTML5SpaceInvaders
========

### ES6
ES6 is compiled to ES5 with Traceur. It used be written in Typescript.

### Gameplay
This game is a multi-player js game based on space invaders. There are 2 screens where players compete.

###Rendering
Presently the Canvas is using block graphics to help people (and myself) just see clearly the bounds of objects and stuff. Feel free to Fork the project on my githup account.

###todo

1 Get game working with clientside WebRTC and have a node.js handshaker server running.
2 Decide if I need an authoritive server to stop client side cheating.
